# Accessible Web Components

A shadow boundary changes how semantics and ARIA work. Two failures dominate: missing semantics inside the shadow tree, and ARIA references that silently break because they cannot cross shadow roots.

Start from semantic markup: use real `<button>`, `<nav>`, `<ul>` inside the template so most semantics come for free, and reserve `ElementInternals`/ARIA for the gaps.

## Default semantics via the ElementInternals ARIA mixin

Set a custom element's role and ARIA state in JS through `ElementInternals`, rather than writing ARIA attributes onto the host. This keeps the semantics as defaults the component owns, while still letting a consumer override them with attributes in the Light DOM.

```javascript
class ToggleSwitch extends HTMLElement {
  #internals;
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.#internals = this.attachInternals();
    this.#internals.role = 'switch';          // default role, no host attribute needed
    this.#internals.ariaChecked = 'false';    // exposed to the accessibility tree
  }
  toggle() {
    const on = this.#internals.ariaChecked !== 'true';
    this.#internals.ariaChecked = String(on);
  }
}
customElements.define('toggle-switch', ToggleSwitch);
```

This avoids polluting the DOM with ARIA attributes and prevents consumers from accidentally clobbering them, while the accessibility tree still sees the correct role and state.

## Focus management and `delegatesFocus`

- Attach the shadow root with `delegatesFocus: true` when the component wraps focusable controls. Focusing the host then forwards focus to the first focusable child, and `:focus`/label clicks behave as users expect.
- For roving focus or moving focus into a newly revealed region, give the target `tabindex="-1"` and call `.focus()`; make programmatically-focusable targets explicit rather than relying on tab order.

## ARIA relationships cannot cross shadow roots

- **MANDATORY**: an `id` referenced by `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-controls`, etc. must live in the **same** tree as the referencing element. An attribute in the Light DOM cannot point at an `id` inside the shadow tree, and vice versa; the reference is silently ignored.
- Keep each ARIA relationship within one root. If a label in the shadow tree must describe a slotted Light DOM element, move the relationship into one tree (e.g. render the label in the Light DOM, or use `aria-label` text instead of an `id` reference).
- For element-to-element references that genuinely must cross roots, the emerging **Reference Target** mechanism is the standards direction, but it is not yet broadly available; design to keep references within a single tree today.
- The reflected ARIA *element* properties — `ariaLabelledByElements`, `ariaDescribedByElements`, and siblings — let you set these relationships to actual element references in JS, with no `id` needed. Browser support is still limited and the rules for referencing across shadow roots are constrained and evolving, so verify before relying on them; today, treat them mainly as a cleaner way to wire *same-tree* relationships without minting ids.

## Fallback strategies

Baseline status for ARIA attribute reflection: Widely available. It's been Baseline since 2023-10-24.
Supported by: Chrome 103 (Jun 2022), Edge 103 (Jun 2022), Firefox 119 (Oct 2023), and Safari 16.4 (Mar 2023).

Where the `ElementInternals` ARIA mixin is unavailable, set the role and ARIA state as attributes on the host instead (`this.setAttribute('role', 'switch')`). It works everywhere, at the cost of putting attributes in the DOM that a consumer could override.
