# Out-of-Order (OOO) HTML Streaming

Out-of-Order (OOO) HTML Streaming (also known as Declarative Partial Updates) is an alternative to the traditional "top-to-bottom" linear processing of HTML. It allows developers to define placeholders earlier in a document and "patch" them with content that arrives later in the same network stream, or via new imperative JavaScript streaming APIs.

## Quick Overview

The feature consists of two primary mechanisms:

1.  **Declarative Patching (HTML-based)**: Uses new processing instructions (`<?marker>`, `<?start>`, `<?end>`) and `<template for>` to swap content in the DOM as it streams in from the server.
2.  **Imperative setting and streaming (JS-based)**: A suite of new methods (e.g., `streamHTML()`, `setHTMLUnsafe()`) that allow setting of HTML or piping readable streams directly into DOM elements with native performance and optional script execution.

## Best Practices

*   **Prioritize Above-the-Fold Content**: Stream critical UI (header, hero, primary navigation, primary content) first. Use placeholders for "expensive" or lower priority components like comments, ads, or related content.
*   **Implement Native Loading States**: Use the `<?start>` and `<?end>` markers to wrap fallback content. The browser automatically replaces everything between these markers when the corresponding `<template for>` arrives.
*   **Minimize Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Always provide stable dimensions for placeholders. If the final content size is unknown, use skeleton screens or CSS `aspect-ratio` to reserve space and prevent jarring shifts.
*   **Accessibility & Focus Management**: Be mindful that out-of-order updates can confuse screen reader users. Use `aria-live` regions for critical updates and ensure that focus isn't lost if a placeholder containing the active element is replaced.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Declarative HTML Markers
The browser looks for specific processing instructions to identify where content should be patched.

```html
<!-- A simple insertion point -->
<div id="sidebar">
  <?marker name="dynamic-comments">
</div>

<!-- A replacement range with loading state -->
<main>
  <?start name="main-content">
    <div class="skeleton">Loading content...</div>
  <?end>
</main>

... (other content) ...

<!-- Later in the same stream, provide the content -->
<template for="dynamic-comments">
  <div class="comments">...</div>
</template>

<template for="main-content">
  <article>
    <h1>The Real Content</h1>
    <p>This replaces the skeleton div automatically.</p>
  </article>
</template>
```

Once a `<template>` replaces an insertion point, that insertion point no longer exists, and can not be reused. However, a `<template>` may contain insertion points that can be used later in the stream.

```html
 <?start name="replaced-content">
  <div class="skeleton">
<?end>
<!-- Later in the same stream, provide initial content -->
<template for="replaced-content">
  <?start name="replaced-content">
    <div>Quickly computed result</div>
  <?end>
</template>
<!-- Later in the same stream, provide full content -->
<template for="replaced-content">
  <?start name="replaced-content">
    <div>Full result</div>
  <?end>
</template>
```

### 2. Imperative JS Streaming

The browser provides a suite of 24 methods (6 actions, each with 4 variations) to update the DOM either statically (from a string) or via a stream.

#### API Reference Matrix

| Action | Static (Safe) | Streaming (Safe) | Static (Unsafe) | Streaming (Unsafe) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Set** | `setHTML()` | `streamHTML()` | `setHTMLUnsafe()` | `streamHTMLUnsafe()` |
| **Replace** | `replaceWithHTML()` | `streamReplaceWithHTML()` | `replaceWithHTMLUnsafe()` | `streamReplaceWithHTMLUnsafe()` |
| **Before** | `beforeHTML()` | `streamBeforeHTML()` | `beforeHTMLUnsafe()` | `streamBeforeHTMLUnsafe()` |
| **Prepend** | `prependHTML()` | `streamPrependHTML()` | `prependHTMLUnsafe()` | `streamPrependHTMLUnsafe()` |
| **Append** | `appendHTML()` | `streamAppendHTML()` | `appendHTMLUnsafe()` | `streamAppendHTMLUnsafe()` |
| **After** | `afterHTML()` | `streamAfterHTML()` | `afterHTMLUnsafe()` | `streamAfterHTMLUnsafe()` |

#### Key Concepts

*   **Safe vs. Unsafe**: 
    *   **Safe** methods (e.g., `setHTML()`) use a built-in sanitizer by default to strip potentially dangerous content like `<script>` tags. You can pass a custom `Sanitizer` object in the options to apply in addition to the default sanitizer.
    *   **Unsafe** methods (e.g., `setHTMLUnsafe()`) do not sanitize by default, but you can still pass a custom `Sanitizer`. To allow scripts to execute in the new content, you must explicitly pass `{ runScripts: true }` in the options. **IMPORTANT**: Only use unsafe methods with trusted content where safe methods would not work.
*   **Static vs. Streaming**:
    *   **Static** methods take a string (or `TrustedHTML`) and apply it immediately.
    *   **Streaming** methods return a `WritableStream`. This allows you to pipe content (e.g., from a `fetch` response) directly into the DOM, and the browser will render it incrementally as chunks arrive.

#### Example: Streaming a Fetch Response

You can pipe fetch responses directly into the DOM without manual chunk handling.

```javascript
const main = document.querySelector('main');
const response = await fetch('/api/partial-update');

// Pipe the stream directly into the element
await response.body
  .pipeThrough(new TextDecoderStream())
  .pipeTo(main.streamHTMLUnsafe({ runScripts: true }));

// Or use the `textStream()` convenience method which streams directly without needing the intermediate `TextDecoderStream()` step
await response
  .textStream()
  .pipeTo(main.streamHTMLUnsafe({ runScripts: true }))
```

## Use Case Reference Matrix

*   **Island Architecture**: Hydrate independent interactive components on top of static HTML without a full framework runtime.
*   **Deferred "Expensive" Blocks**: Deliver the shell of a page immediately and stream database-heavy components as they become available.
*   **Single Page Application (SPA) Updates**: Stream large UI transitions in SPAs using `streamHTML()` instead of waiting for a full JSON payload and manual DOM construction.

## Anti-Patterns & Warnings (DO NOT DO THIS)

*   **Do not use OOO streaming for everything.** Over-fragmenting a page can increase the complexity of the stream and potentially delay content if the browser spends too much time patching small nodes.
*   **Do not ignore Trusted Types.** When using `*Unsafe` methods in environments with Trusted Types enforced, ensure you are passing a sanitized policy object if required.
*   **Do not assume script execution order.** Scripts inside a `<template for>` will execute as soon as they are patched into the document. Do not rely on them executing in a specific sequence relative to other deferred templates.
*   **Do not use without a polyfill strategy.** Ensure you have a fallback or use polyfills (`html-setters-polyfill` and `template-for-polyfill`) to support your required browsers until this feature becomes Baseline.

## Fallback strategies

<template for> has limited availability.
Supported by: Chrome 150 and Edge 150.
Unsupported in: Firefox and Safari.

HTML setter methods is not natively supported by any major browser yet.

HTML streaming setters is not natively supported by any major browser yet.

HTML processing instructions has limited availability.
Supported by: Chrome 150 and Edge 150.
Unsupported in: Firefox and Safari.

You can use polyfills like `template-for-polyfill` and `html-setters-polyfill` to emulate the API surface for non-supporting browsers.

Browsers without `html-processing-instructions` support parse `<?marker>`, `<?start>`, and `<?end>` as comments. `template-for-polyfill` still recognizes these comments as markers, so keep the same processing instruction syntax for all browsers. Do not rewrite the markers as HTML comments or elements for non-supporting browsers.
