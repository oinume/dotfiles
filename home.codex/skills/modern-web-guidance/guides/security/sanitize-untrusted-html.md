# Sanitizing Untrusted HTML

Safely displaying user-generated HTML is a common security challenge. The native **Sanitizer API** provides a built-in, browser-optimized way to strip dangerous content (like `<script>` tags or `on*` attributes) before it reaches the DOM.

Client-side sanitization protects the page that renders the content. If the same user-generated content is also rendered elsewhere (other clients, server-rendered pages, or emails), sanitize it on the server as well as defence in depth, and make sure the server and client sanitization rules do not conflict.

## 1. Safely Inserting HTML with `setHTML()`

The primary way to use the Sanitizer API is through the `setHTML()` method on any `Element`. This method handles parsing, sanitization and insertion in a single step, ensuring that content is sanitized specifically for the context in which it will be inserted.

```javascript
const untrustedHTML = `
  <p>Hello!</p>
  <script>alert('XSS')</script>
  <img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">
  <div onclick="doBadThing()">Click me</div>
`;

const container = document.getElementById('output');

// Sanitize and insert in one call
// The default sanitizer removes scripts and event handlers, plus other
// elements and attributes outside its built-in allowlist (such as style)
container.setHTML(untrustedHTML);
```

## 2. Using Custom Sanitizer Configurations

You can customize the sanitization rules by creating a `Sanitizer` instance. This allows you to define exactly which elements and attributes are permitted for your specific use case.

When using `Element.setHTML()` and `Document.parseHTML()`, the default `Sanitizer` settings remove all XSS-unsafe elements and attributes. You cannot make a more permissive `Sanitizer` that allows those elements, but you can further restrict what is allowed.

```javascript
// Define a restrictive configuration that only allows the specified elements and attributes.
const config = {
  elements: ["p", "b", "i", "strong", "em"],
  attributes: ["class"],
  replaceWithChildrenElements: ['div']
};

const mySanitizer = new Sanitizer(config);

// Apply custom sanitization
container.setHTML(untrustedHTML, { sanitizer: mySanitizer });
```

Elements that are not in `elements` are removed **together with their content**. List wrapper elements whose text you want to keep (such as `div` above) in `replaceWithChildrenElements`, which removes the element but keeps its children.

If you need a more permissive `Sanitizer` that allows some XSS-unsafe elements or attributes, you can use a custom Sanitizer with `Element.setHTMLUnsafe()` and `Document.parseHTMLUnsafe()`.

## 3. Parsing User Input with `Document.parseHTML()`

If you need to parse untrusted HTML without immediately inserting it into the live DOM, use `Document.parseHTML()`. This method returns a `Document` that has been sanitized according to default or custom rules, so you can inspect or transform the sanitized nodes (for example, to build a preview or extract text) before inserting them.

Move the resulting nodes into the page rather than serializing them to a string and re-parsing it with `innerHTML`, which can reintroduce mutation XSS (mXSS).

```javascript
const rawHTML = '<p>Hello <script>console.log("bad")</script></p>';

const doc = Document.parseHTML(rawHTML);
// doc.body now contains the sanitized nodes: <p>Hello </p>
preview.replaceChildren(...doc.body.childNodes);
```

## Fallbacks & browser support for Sanitizer API

Sanitizer API has limited availability.
Supported by: Chrome 146 (Mar 2026), Edge 146 (Mar 2026), and Firefox 148 (Feb 2026).
Unsupported in: Safari.

If the native Sanitizer API is not available in your target browsers, load a library like **DOMPurify** only when native support is missing, to avoid shipping it to browsers that don't need it. Use `in` checks for feature detection so the check itself works in older browsers.

```javascript
let domPurifyPromise;

function loadDOMPurify() {
  // Code-split with your bundler so DOMPurify is only downloaded when needed
  domPurifyPromise ??= import('dompurify').then((mod) => mod.default ?? mod);
  return domPurifyPromise;
}

export async function safeSetHTML(el, html) {
  const elements = ['p', 'b', 'i', 'strong', 'em'];
  const attributes = ['class'];

  if ('setHTML' in Element.prototype) {
    // setHTML() accepts a plain configuration object as the sanitizer
    el.setHTML(html, { sanitizer: { elements, attributes } });
  } else {
    const DOMPurify = await loadDOMPurify();
    el.innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(html, {
      ALLOWED_TAGS: [...elements, '#text'],
      ALLOWED_ATTR: attributes,
      // Match the native Sanitizer: remove disallowed elements with their content
      KEEP_CONTENT: false
    });
  }
}
```

By default, DOMPurify keeps the text content of elements it removes, while the native Sanitizer removes disallowed elements together with their content. Setting `KEEP_CONTENT: false` and allowing `#text` makes DOMPurify match the native behavior. DOMPurify has no built-in option equivalent to `replaceWithChildrenElements`, so avoid that option in configurations that need a matching fallback.

If the page enforces Trusted Types (`require-trusted-types-for 'script'`), assigning a string to `innerHTML` throws. `setHTML()` does not need a Trusted Types policy, but the fallback does: pass `RETURN_TRUSTED_TYPE: true` to `DOMPurify.sanitize()` and allow its `dompurify` policy name in your `trusted-types` CSP directive.
