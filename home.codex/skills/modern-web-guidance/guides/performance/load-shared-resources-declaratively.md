# Load shared resources declaratively

Popular scripts, stylesheets, and JavaScript modules, such as UI frameworks or widget libraries served from a CDN, are byte-for-byte identical across many unrelated sites, yet every site's visitors download and cache their own copy. Cross-Origin Storage (COS) lets the browser keep one on-device copy of such a file, identified by its content hash, and serve it to every site that references the same bytes. Resources that already carry an `integrity` hash opt in through markup or import syntax alone: the `crossoriginstorage` attribute on `<link>` and `<script>` elements, or the `crossOriginStorage` import attribute on static and dynamic module imports. The browser handles the lookup, the network fallback, and storing the file, so no custom caching code is needed.

## How to implement

1. **Start from `integrity`.** Both declarative forms require an existing, valid `integrity` hash on the element or import, since that hash is what identifies the file in COS.
2. **Add the COS attribute alongside it.** For HTML, add `crossoriginstorage` to a `<link>` or `<script>` element. For module imports, add `crossOriginStorage` inside the same `with { ... }` block as `integrity`.
3. **Choose the sharing scope.** Pick it from the resource's real distribution, as described in the "Sharing scope" section.
4. **For module imports, use dynamic `import()` inside `try`/`catch`.** A static `import` with an unsupported `crossOriginStorage` key fails the whole module at parse time, and a dynamic `import()` with one rejects before fetching anything. Catch the rejection and import the same URL without the attribute.

## Example code

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="/assets/shared-widget.css"
  integrity="sha256-example-only-hash"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
  crossoriginstorage="*"
/>
<script
  src="/assets/shared-widget.js"
  integrity="sha256-example-only-hash"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
  crossoriginstorage="*"
  defer
></script>
```

```javascript
// MANDATORY: Use dynamic import() inside try/catch. A browser without
// native support for the crossOriginStorage import attribute rejects it
// before fetching anything, even when navigator.crossOriginStorage exists
// (for example, added by an extension), so that object is no signal for
// import attribute support.
let mod;
try {
  mod = await import('/assets/shared-config.js', {
    with: {
      integrity: 'sha256-YKd8aU4ILF6re6EiM6lTEdAiGTFjVgVk9867zPSCAhs=',
      crossOriginStorage: '*',
    },
  });
} catch {
  // Fall back to a plain import of the same URL.
  mod = await import('/assets/shared-config.js');
}
```

## Sharing scope

Every Cross-Origin Storage (COS) surface takes a sharing scope that controls which origins can later retrieve the stored file. Pick the scope that matches the resource's real distribution:

- **Same-site only (default):** for resources that only your own site uses.
- **Explicit origin list:** for a small, trusted set of origins, for example proprietary assets shared between your own properties.
- **Global (`*`):** **MANDATORY:** only for genuinely popular, non-proprietary resources, such as open-weight AI models or widely used open-source libraries.

| Surface | Same-site only | Origin list | Global |
|---|---|---|---|
| `requestFileHandle()` `origins` option | Omit `origins` | Array of origin strings | `'*'` |
| HTML `crossoriginstorage` attribute | Valueless attribute | Space-separated origins | `"*"` |
| `crossOriginStorage` import attribute | Empty string (`''`) | Space-separated origins | `'*'` |
| CSS `cross-origin-storage()` modifier | No arguments | Comma-separated origin strings | `*` |

**MANDATORY:** An origin list only takes effect for origins that a `Cross-Origin-Storage-Allow-Origin` response header also names, for example `Cross-Origin-Storage-Allow-Origin: https://a.example, https://b.example`. The header comes from whoever supplies the bytes: the response of the page that calls `requestFileHandle()`, or the response of the fetched resource itself (the script, stylesheet, module, or font) for the HTML, import attribute, and CSS forms. Origins the header doesn't name are dropped, and if none remain, the file is stored with the same-site default. The same-site default and `*` need no header.

## Best practices

- **DO** keep the `src`/`href`/module specifier pointing at the resource's real, working network URL, since a COS lookup that doesn't succeed falls back to that URL exactly like ordinary `integrity`-checked fetches do.
- **DO NOT** introduce a separate imperative fetch/cache step in JavaScript for a resource that already carries `integrity`; add the declarative attribute instead.
- **DO NOT** confuse the HTML `crossoriginstorage` attribute with the unrelated `crossorigin` attribute. `crossorigin` sets the CORS request mode, and both can coexist on the same element.
- **DO NOT** confuse the CSS `cross-origin-storage()` modifier with the unrelated CSS `cross-origin()` modifier, which also sets the CORS request mode.

## Fallback strategy

Cross-Origin Storage (COS) is being implemented in Chromium and is not yet natively supported by any major browser. Until it ships, the Cross-Origin Storage browser extension adds it to Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers (from the Chrome Web Store), Firefox on desktop and Android (from Firefox Add-ons), and Safari on macOS, iOS, and iPadOS (from the App Store). The extension supports the literal syntax of the `navigator.crossOriginStorage` API, the HTML `crossoriginstorage` attribute, and the CSS `cross-origin-storage()` modifier. It does not support the literal `crossOriginStorage` import attribute, since import attribute syntax can't be polyfilled.

The HTML form degrades gracefully: a browser that doesn't recognize `crossoriginstorage` simply ignores the attribute, per ordinary HTML attribute-parsing rules, and the element still loads via its plain `href`/`src`. The static JavaScript import-attribute form does not degrade the same way, since an unrecognized `with` key is a hard failure; use dynamic `import()` inside `try`/`catch` as shown in the example.

With the extension installed, `navigator.crossOriginStorage` exists, but the literal import attribute still fails: a static `import` fails to parse, and a dynamic `import()` rejects. For module imports, the extension provides two non-standard shims:

- **`<script type="module-cos">`:** the extension reads the script as text, resolves every static or dynamic import that carries `crossOriginStorage` and has a literal string specifier, and runs the rewritten source as a regular module. Computed specifiers such as variables or template literals are not rewritten.
- **`navigator.crossOriginStorage.__non_standard__import(specifier, options)`:** takes the same arguments as dynamic `import()`, including a computed specifier.

**DO NOT** make either shim the only code path, since neither exists outside the extension.
